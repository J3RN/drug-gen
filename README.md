# drug-gen

An application that generates exciting names for your new pharmaceutical!

Drug name data ([database.txt](/database.txt)) is synthesized from the [Drugs@FDA Data Files]. Thanks to the FDA for making this data available for my fun and whimsy!

This is a [Stack] project, so you can compile the application with `stack build`.
